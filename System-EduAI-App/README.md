# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

## Current Status ✅

The application has been **significantly improved** with better backend connectivity and error handling:

### Fixed Issues:
- ✅ **Import Path Error**: Fixed AuthContext import from `../api/publicApi` to `../services/api`
- ✅ **Backend Connection**: Improved automatic backend switching and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ **Mock Mode**: Enhanced mock data for offline development and testing
- ✅ **Teacher Role**: Complete teacher functionality with proper data handling
- ✅ **UI Components**: All screens render properly with error boundaries

### Current Features:
- 🔄 **Smart Backend Detection**: Automatically finds working backend servers
- 📱 **Mock Mode Fallback**: App works offline with sample data
- 👨‍🏫 **Teacher Dashboard**: Complete teacher interface with data management
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parent Portal**: Parent interface for student monitoring
- 👶 **Student View**: Student-specific interface and features
- 💬 **Messaging System**: Chat functionality between teachers and parents
- 📊 **Health Tracking**: Student health and growth monitoring
- 📸 **Photo Albums**: Class photo management
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Secure login with role-based access

### Backend Connection Status:
- 🔍 **Auto-Discovery**: Tests multiple backend URLs automatically
- ⚠️ **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to mock mode when backends are offline
- 🔄 **Smart Retry**: Automatically switches to working backends
- 📊 **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time backend status display

## Troubleshooting Backend Connection

If you see "Backend offline" or "Mock mode":

1. **Start Spring Boot Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend-project
   mvn spring-boot:run
   # or
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

2. **Check Network**: Ensure frontend and backend are on same WiFi network

3. **Verify Port**: Backend should run on port 8080

4. **Firewall**: Check if port 8080 is accessible

5. **Manual Backend Selection**: Use the backend selector in login screen

## Demo Mode

The app includes comprehensive mock data, so you can:
- ✅ Test all features without backend
- ✅ Demo the complete user experience  
- ✅ Develop frontend features independently
- ✅ Show stakeholders the full application flow
